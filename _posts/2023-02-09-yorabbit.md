### Introduction

[Year Of The Rabbit] is a hard CTF on TryHackMe that has several rabbit holes, but not too difficult to solve.

I solve it without following what had to be done, but instead taking advantage of a vulnerability in the installed version of sudo.

Let's start scanning the machine with nmap like always.

```sh
nmap -sSV -p- --open --min-rate 5000 <IP> -oN <outputfile.txt>
```

We can see FTP, SSH and HTTP ports open.

![scan](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura.PNG)

First we gonna see if we can connect like anonymous in the FTP.

```sh
ftp <IP>
```

But how we can see, we can't. So lets move to the web.

![ftp](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura1.PNG)

When we go to the page, we can see that have an apache web default.

![web](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura2.PNG)

Let's do a directory scan to see if there is something.

```sh
gobuster dir -u http://<IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 40 -q -x html,php,txt
```

![web scan](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura3.PNG)

The scan returned a directory called **assets**.

Looking in the directory we can see 2 files, **RickRolled.mp4** and **style.css**.

![web assets](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura4.PNG)

In the **style.css**, If we look the content we can see one comment refering to a php file, called **sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php**.

![style.css](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura5.PNG)

If we go to the file, this redirect to us to the **Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up** music video.
We fell in a rabbit hole.

Time to try to disable java.

And again is a rabbit hole.

![no javas](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura8.PNG)

Let's try to refresh the page and see the network activity, If in some case we are missing something.

Voil√†! We got something interesting.

There is a get request to a file, but it seems more to a directory.

![network intercept](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura9.PNG)

If we move on to the directory, we can see a png file.

Time to download It and inspect It.

![secret folder](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura10.PNG)

Looking a bit here and there.

If we string the image, we can found some interesting.

```sh
strings Hot_Babe.png
```

![strings](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura11.PNG)

There is a phrase, giving us the FTP user and a bunch of passwords.

![dictionary](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura12.PNG)

Let's make a dictionary with the passwords and try to make a bruteforce.

```sh
hydra -l ftpuser -P <password dictionary> <IP> ftp
or
hydra -L <users file> -P <password dictionary> <IP> ftp
```

![ftp brute](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura13.PNG)

Once we get the password, It's time to connect to FTP.

There is a file called **Eli's_creds.txt**, let's get it and see if there are real valid credentials and is not another rabbit hole.

```sh
ftp <IP>
ls
get "Eli's_Creds.txt"
```

![ftp conn](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura14.PNG)

It seems to be something but is encoded.

```sh
cat "Eli's_Creds.txt"
```

If we copy the content and use [DCode Cypher Identifier], returns that is encoded in **BrainFuck**.

![Eli creds](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura15.PNG)

To decode [BrainFuck] we can use the page's own tool to do it and get the text.

We got eli credentials, let's try to connect to the machine.

![brainfuck](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura16.PNG)

Seems to be valid credentials, the connection work.

```sh
ssh eli@<IP>
```

We can see that there is a message when we connect to Gwendoline.

![ssh eli](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura17.PNG)

***Note: At this point, I didn't follow the "correct" path to escalation. I used linpeas and take advantage of sudo vulnerability to escalate to root.***

Let's use a tool/script called [LinPEAS] that search for possible paths to escalate privileges on Linux/Unix*/MacOS hosts.

```sh
bash linpeas.sh
or
./linpeas.sh
```

![linpeas](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura18.PNG)

We can see that the script returned, the **sudo** version of the machine, is vulnerable.

![linpeas cve](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura19.PNG)

Researching a little we can find an [exploit].

Let's try to use It and see if It works.

![cve exploit](/images/THM/yorabbit/Captura20.PNG)

The exploit works and we got the root prompt.

Now we can see the flags, and with this we've completed the machine.

```sh
bash script.sh
or
./script.sh
id
python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
cat /home/gwendoline/user.txt
cat /root/root.txt
```

- What is the user flag?

- What is the root flag?
